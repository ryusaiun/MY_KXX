 uob_eu.0.d:0 "The Grand Protector Of Britain and the Revolution, sits in his office in deep thought. He had secured his place in the government. He had removed his rivals from power, and rallied the people to his cause. However now there was nothing else for him to do but to do government work. Sure it is great to enact polices and to contribute to the revolutionary cause, but other than is it.  It is very boring to just sit in this dam office all day and just wait for something to happen. The Grand Protector is the protector of Britain… but what about becoming the protector of all of Europe? \nA light bulb has come to head been lit, and there was no way to turn it off! Britain might be the protector of their revolution, but why not be the guardian of the all of Europe?! Everyone should be under the revolutionary banner of a United Europe! Britain can do more then their French counterparts can! They can destroy the Kaiserreich, subdue any capitalist that stands in their way, and they can destroy any counterrevolution with just the swipe of the sword! \n\nThis idea will be imprinted into history, this will be the defining symbol of the revolution! Britain might be the only one free today, but tomorrow Europe will be free and unite!"

 uob_eu.1.d:0 ""Smith!" - loud shout form a teacher could be heared across the classrom. Middle-aged man with glasses and short hair, staring at one of the students from behind the desk, was looking nervous. He didn't like his job, but he had to do it - as a member of the Party, he had to teach theses kids how a true revolutionary thinks - in a way of Oswald Mosley. \n"Yes sir." - young, high-pitched voice could be heard from across the room, and one student has stood up at his desk. \n"What does Supreme Leader Oswald Mosley thinks about the capitalists?" \n"They should be hanged, along with ethnonationalists, reactionaries and other enemies of the people and state." \n"Correct, you pass." - the teacher said without confidence. The bell rang across the school, and the kids went to their homes. The teacher has stayed there, thinking about his life. He would never think that being a syndicalist would give him a job, but he was wrong. Now, he sat at teachers chair, looking through his notes, and everything was sorting out."

He finally has fulfilled his vision, finally his revolution is completed. Destruction of America, conquest of Africa, but most importantly - unification of Europe. He was proud of himself, and he was ready to proclaim that pride. He has prepared for that moment for years, and finally it came! \nSupreme Leader came out of his office, and was heading towards the Trafalgar Square. His armored car was meant to be bullet-proof, and Lord Mosley got inside of it without second thought. \nThen the car has reached the Square, Supreme Leader came out of it to greet his people. His lovely Europeans, his subjects, his hands and his eyes. This happines couldn't last forever. \n \nLoud bang, sharp pain in the chest. This is what Lord Protector felt - and the last thing he has heard that day was gunfight, with few men dropping along with him."

After the death of Oswald Mosley, it was obvious that chaos would engulf the continent, the recent Volkist attempt has shown that. The initial attack occurred at the Japanese Embassy in the middle of the night, an act of sheer desperation from these bastards. The remains of the ambassador’s office were smoldering, and the ambassador himself had been driven off, along with some of his aides. Poor guy was massacred. From that moment on, a complicated and dramatic conflict began - especially from people angry at the idea of having a Japanese embassy at all.\nHarry Pollitt and his goons betrayed me, their own Grand Protector of the European Revolution, an heir and head of National Syndicalism.

From what was established, we surely know that the European Socialists are interested in cooperating with the Communists, but concessions will be necessary. First of all, new European Union will need to reject authoritarian and vanguardist doctrine of Leninism. However, Social Democratic doctrine of establishing a traditionally democratic society is not an option due to communist opposition towards such idea, and a compromise was reached. Workers democracy, where a singular party is in charge, but the party itself is divided into sections, or factions, as one may call it. Each faction will start in elections, and the citizens will be able to choose between their favourite candidates from each group. Currently, only the Communists and Social Democrats are available as an option, but at the same time we may see more and more organizations and groups joining the government. Time will tell."

At the same time, a group called colloquially "Eurosyndies", or European Syndicalists, have also joined the negotiations at the round table. They are an interesting case, since their numbers are a lot smaller than what other factions provide, but at the same time they are able to provide any degree of legitimacy, due to former existence of the Commune of France, Union of Britain and Socialist Italy.

Pushing the agenda of free market led by workers councils, Market Socialists have gathered support of various economists, political activists and some other influential figures in Italy.\n\nThe Technocratic faction, which is the most suprising, has sprung out of people dissatisfied with "popular" forms of government. Technocrats support establishing a cabined composed of people qualified in their fields, rather than politically loyal or elected by the people. Their argument is that more qualified ministers shall rule better than others, due to their knowledge in their fields.\n\nThe last group, the Humanists or Social Democrats, composed of various former political prisoners and other elements previously seen as undesirable, promote the shocking idea of reestablishing capitalism as it was before the Weltkrieg. This people, however, are aware of dangers of capitalism, supporting establishment of a welfare state, based on personal liberty, cutting ties with Totalist regimes and creating more independent Italy, that would bring liberty and this moderate socialism to people's across the world.\n\nWhat shall Ciano do?"

He believes that a politically engaged military can serve as a catalyst for social transformation, reflecting the aspirations of the people.\nIn stark contrast, Mohamed Naguib champions a contrasting vision - the total depoliticization of the armed forces. Naguib asserts that the military's primary duty lies in safeguarding the nation's security, free from the entanglements of partisan politics. He contends that a politically neutral military ensures stability, safeguards national unity, and upholds the rule of law. Naguib's pragmatic approach calls for the military's detachment from political intrigues, allowing it to focus solely on its constitutional responsibilities.\nAs tensions escalate within the Free Officers' circle, the choices made in this pivotal moment will indelibly shape the Egyptian military's character. Will Egypt's armed forces become a force of political change under Nasser's radical proposal, intertwining military might with political ideology?

Nasser envisions an Egypt untethered from religious constraints, where governance, education, and cultural expressions stand independent from religious doctrines. He argues that secularism will foster modernity, equality, and intellectual freedom, liberating the nation from centuries-old dogmas.\nIn contrast, Mohamed Naguib staunchly upholds a more traditional perspective - the preservation of societal norms rooted in conservatism. Naguib posits that societal progress should not come at the cost of destabilizing established values and traditions. He advocates for a delicate balance between modernity and continuity, asserting that Egypt's cultural identity and moral fabric are intertwined with its religious heritage. Naguib believes that tampering with religious matters could ignite social unrest and erode the moral foundation of the nation.\nAs tensions escalate within the Free Officers' circle, the choices made in this pivotal moment will profoundly shape Egypt's social fabric. Will Nasser's visionary proposal lead to the complete secularization of society, ushering in a new era of intellectual freedom and modernity?

Nasser envisions a cooperative relationship between the executive and legislative branches, where decisions are made through deliberation, fostering a more inclusive and representative government.\nIn contrast, Mohamed Naguib staunchly advocates for a concentrated exercise of power, firmly advocating for the Premier to hold a dominant role. Naguib proposes a model in which authority remains concentrated in the hands of the President, which he currently occupies. He asserts that a strong executive can streamline decision-making, ensuring swift responses to national challenges without being bogged down by bureaucratic processes.\nAs tensions escalate within the Free Officers' circle, the choices made in this pivotal moment will decisively shape Egypt's governance structure. Will Nasser's vision of power-sharing between the Premier and the parliament lead to a more collaborative and inclusive government?

Nasser envisions a society free from the vestiges of aristocratic privilege, where wealth and influence are redistributed among the broader population. He argues that uprooting the former elite is essential to realize the full potential of the republic and to create a more egalitarian society.\nConversely, Mohamed Naguib advocates for a more pragmatic approach to the republic's preservation. Naguib suggests that while the republic's principles should be upheld, interfering with the former elite might lead to instability and resentment. He proposes a compromise where the republican order is maintained but without direct actions against the former aristocracy. Naguib believes that a peaceful transition, rather than radical upheaval, will ensure the republic's stability and encourage cooperation among different segments of society.\nAs tensions rise within the Free Officers' circle, the decisions made in this pivotal moment will indelibly shape Egypt's socio-economic landscape. Will Nasser's uncompromising stance on dismantling the nobles and landlords lead to a more egalitarian society, albeit potentially disruptive?

Nasser envisions transcending borders to forge a cohesive identity among Arab nations, rallying them together for shared goals. He believes that a unified Arab party can foster solidarity, strengthen regional cooperation, and amplify Egypt's influence on the international stage.\nMeanwhile, Mohamed Naguib champions a different approach, emphasizing a more centralized rallying point. Naguib proposes the creation of a Presidential Front, aligning people behind the current President (Naguib himself). He argues that consolidating power and unity under a strong executive leadership can streamline decision-making, enhance national cohesion, and maintain stability during a time of transformation.\nAs tensions escalate among the Free Officers, the choices made in this critical juncture will decisively influence Egypt's path forward. Will Nasser's vision of a united Arab party ignite cross-border alliances, ushering in a new era of regional cooperation and influence?

Nasser envisions harnessing the energy of these movements to address social issues, believing that their participation can lead to equitable labor practices, improved worker conditions, and social progress.\nIn contrast, Mohamed Naguib adamantly argues for the removal of syndicalists from Egypt's landscape. He expresses concerns about their atheistic tendencies and radical progressivism, which he perceives as threats to Egypt's social fabric and stability. Naguib contends that their ideologies could sow discord and potentially undermine the cultural values and religious foundations that have long held the society together.\nAs tensions escalate within the Free Officers' circle, the choices made in this pivotal moment will undeniably shape Egypt's sociopolitical landscape. Will Nasser's vision of collaboration with syndicalists prevail, potentially leading to societal transformation and labor reforms?

The proposal on the table suggests the removal of the position of Head of State, effectively transferring all executive powers and responsibilities to the Volkskammer, the nation's parliament.\nErnst Thalmann, a revered figure in the syndicalist movement and leader of the state, sees this change as unnecessary. Proponents argue that this change would further emphasize the principles of people's democracy and decentralize power. The Volkskammer, already representing the will of the people, would assume direct control over the nation's affairs, including foreign relations, domestic policies, and military matters.\nHowever, critics warn of potential risks and challenges associated with such a dramatic shift in governance. They raise concerns about the stability of the state, the ability to respond swiftly to crises, and the potential for political gridlock as the Volkskammer grapples with these new responsibilities.\nThe decision to abolish the Head of State position and entrust the Volkskammer with such extensive powers will undoubtedly shape the future of the German Democratic Republic.

They argue for the expansion of the welfare state, increased worker control of industries, and closer collaboration with the Third Internationale. Their vision prioritizes social equality and greater government intervention in the economy as a means to achieve it.\n\nOpposing them are the Social Democrats, headed by Willy Brandt. This faction champions a more moderate, social-democratic approach, emphasizing the idea of forging Germany's own destiny. They advocate for a mixed economy, market reforms, and greater individual liberties, all within a framework of social welfare. Brandt's followers believe in maintaining a delicate balance between socialism and capitalism.\n\nAs the SPD grapples with this internal power struggle, the outcome will significantly impact the party's trajectory and its role on the world stage. The choice between a more radical socialist path and a moderate, social-democratic one will shape the future direction of Germany and its relations with other nations.

Germany would continue to engage with its neighbors through bilateral agreements and international organizations.\n\nDiplomatic Establishment of the European Union - Advocates of this path propose a diplomatic approach to European integration. The SPD would work towards strengthening existing international organizations, fostering cooperation between European nations, and creating a framework for economic and political collaboration, ultimately establishing a European Union.\n\nEstablishing a Federation of Europe - the most ambitious option, this path envisions a united Europe with a centralized federal government. Advocates argue that such a federation would bring about significant social and political change across the continent, promoting a shared social democratic vision, economic integration, and collaborative governance.\n\nThe SPD's decision on the future of European integration will have far-reaching consequences for both Germany and the entire continent. Will they reject the idea of European integration, pursue a diplomatic European Union, or ambitiously work towards a federated Europe, ushering in a new era of social change and cooperation?

More moderate factions have also pointed to the militarization of Britain under Mosley's rule, with many fearing that his plans to conquer the rest of Europe may come true.
