 nasserism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Nasserism)§!\n\nUnique socialistic ideology developed by Gamal Abdel Nasser, Nasserism is combination of Arab socialism with charterist Totalism. Combining Arab nationalism with radical anti-colonialism, state ownership of public utilities and natural resources, state control over the trade, and workers representation in profit-sharing. All of that system is protected by one party - an Arab party, that protects all people across the land it governs. \n \nThis revolutionary ideology is obviously hard to enforce on traditionalist Arab population, but the Chairman - Gamal Abdel Nasser - shall ensure that progress will reach the Arab world"

All public titles held by Germans will be immediately stripped from them. Following order shall be introduced immediately". \n\nThat information has sparked a lot of stress in population of Suez Canal. A lot of Germans brought there in previous months have to leave the country, with no perspectives. German Empire has announced humanitarian help for the refugees, and has condemned our Administration for such act - but we can't afford rise of another Hess, our beautiful Colony can't fail in its Holy task of bringing the glory for the Empire."

 HESS_SUEZ_DESC:0 "Stellvertretender Kommissar Rudolf Walter Richard Heß is a strange fellow indeed. A German born to Wealthy Bohemian German parents in not Germany but in Ibrahimieh, a suburb of Alexandria, British occupied Egypt. Hess's youth in Egypt left him with a lifelong contempt for non-white peoples together with a strong admiration for the British Empire. When outbreak of the Weltkrieg happened he enlisted Hess enlisted in the 7th Bavarian Field Artillery Regiment, part of the 1st Royal Bavarian Division. He would be serve bravely and would be reward the Iron Cross, 2nd Class. In a post Weltkrieg world Hess returned Egypt and got a job at the recently occupied Suez Canal Zone. There would rise through the rank of the organization to become head “Stellvertretender Kommissar” of the Suezkanal-Behörde. As Stellvertretender Kommissar he has abusing his powers for personal gain. He has been using the Zentrale Einsatzkräfte as armed thugs to help him make a profit of the illustrious revenue of the international market, he has abused his workers to work long hours for little pay, used intimidation and murder to get what he wants, and has terrorizes the locals with his pillaging army. He and his friends such as Herman Göring, and Reinhard Heydrich, rule the Suezkanal-Behörde as if it was their own personal kingdom but is still somewhat loyal to government in Berlin. He is a crooked man indeed. Hated by everyone and loathed by socialists…"
 POLITICS_VICKY_I_DESC:0 "Princess Victoria Louise Adelaide Matilda Charlotte Von Hohenzollern of Prussia, the daughter of Kaiser Wilhelm, the third to bear the name
Victoria' after her grandmother, German Empress Victoria, and her great-grandmother Queen Victoria. One of the least expected people of the Kaiser’s seven children to take over the throne of the Kaiserreich. However after her father and most of her family died in a terrible car accident. Now she has become Kaiserin Victoria I. Of Her Name, German Empress, by the Grace of God, Mother of the Reichspakt, Queen of Prussia, Margravine of Brandenburg, Sovereign and Supreme Duke of Silesia, Grand Duchess of the Lower Rhine and Posen, Duchess consort of Brunswick, Duchess of Saxony, Westphalia and Pomerania, of Lüneburg and Bremen, of Holstein, Schleswig and Lauenburg, Burgravine of Nuremberg, Landgrave of Hesse, Princess of East Frisia, Osnabrück and Hildesheim, of Nassau and Fulda, Countess of Hohenzollern, Lady of Frankfurt. She has always been popular with the people and she had always been the favorite child of the Kaiser. This has to due with her beauty and her populist attitude towards politics. Strangely she had always publicly mentioned wishing to be in alliance with the Entente and to heal old wounds with them over the Weltkrieg. Even though she is loved by many, there are elements from both the left and the right who see her as a threat to their plans. All this combined with the fact her reign has begun with the end of a Golden Age for Germany, the death of the Kaiser, and the worst global economic crisis in history. She will have alot of work to do to fix the Fatherland and bring the a bright future to Germany."
