por.400.t:0 "Supremacy in West Africa"
por.400.d:0 "With Portuguese control of French Guinea, Sierra Leone, and the Ivory Coast, and any [700.owner.GetAdjective] recapture attempt likely to incur massive casualties, it is clear the [700.owner.GetAdjective] army is on the backfoot. It may be wise to inform [700.owner.GetNameDef] that if they ever intend to return home they should admit defeat, else get bogged down in a colonial war over some not very vital lands."

por.401.d.a:0 "With Portuguese control of French Guinea, Sierra Leone, and the Ivory Coast, it is clear the military situation has developed in a manner not in our favour. Any recapture attempt likely to incur massive casualties, and we cannot afford to lose the proud Frenchmen that will be needed for the reclamation. Do we accept their terms?"
por.401.d.b:0 "With Portuguese control of Guinea, Sierra Leone, and the Ivory Coast, it is clear the military situation has developed in a manner not in our favour.

por.402.d:0 "The heat seems to have got to the heads of [700.owner.GetNameDef], and they have outright rejected our merciful terms! It is clear peace was never an option. We must march on [700.owner.capital.GetName] and make [700.owner.GetAdjective] North Africa Portuguese North Africa!"
por.402.a:0 "To [700.owner.capital.GetName] it is. Avante!"

por.405.t:0 "Control of the Buffer"
por.405.d:0 "Our armies have managed to reach the extent of the planned buffer. While we could go further, the strain on our armies to fight the war and on the state to administer the region would be great. If we send an agreement to [868.owner.GetNameDef] demanding the buffer in exchange for peace and Portuguese withdrawl from lands beyond the buffer, they will likely accept. What will it be?"

por.406.t:0 "The Portuguese March from Goa!"

por.415.d.a:0 "Our armies have raced into Galicia, and the region is now under our control. We can demand [171.owner.GetNameDef] recognise our annexation of the region in exchange for peace, demands they are likely to accept with the numerous other issues their country faces other then a Portuguese invasion. Or, we can venture futher, and neutralise the [171.owner.GetAdjective] threat for good, although public support for the war wanes with no clear aim for the remainder of the war."
por.415.d.b:0 "Our armies have raced into Galicia, and the region is now under our control. We can demand [171.owner.GetNameDef] recognise our annexation of the region in exchange for peace, demands they are likely to accept with the numerous other issues their country faces other then a Portuguese invasion.

por.430.d:0 "Our marines staged a daring landing in the Panama Canal, encountering resistance, securing the area and arresting the remainders of the [685.owner.GetAdjective] garrison and civilian personnel. We can demand sovereignty over the canal in exchange for the return of the prisoners to their families, terms we consider more than fair. Or, we can continue this war further."

por.432.d.b:0 "The Canadians have reacted with outrage to our seizure of the canal. They have called it, among other things, a gross betrayal. They have outright rejected our demands."

por.440.t:0 "Constantinople is Ours!"
por.440.d:0 "Our forces have siezed the Bospherous, and the city of the worlds desire, which is now in the hands of the faithful. We can demand the city and surrounding region, or continue our crusade into the rest of Anatolia."

This is a national humiliation in [336.owner.GetName], and the [336.owner.GetAdjective] public is already demanding terms of peace with Portugal before more fall to Portuguese arms. As Portuguese men, women and children celebrate in the streets over this victory, it is now down to us: Do we stop at Singapore or advance into [336.owner.GetName] until it is all ours?"
por.480.a:0 "Singapore will Suffice"

por.485.t:0 "Djibouti is in our hands!"
por.485.d.a:0 "While little attention has been paid to Djibouti by [268.owner.GetNameDef], natually they are outraged now we have seized it. However, with our control of the Suez preventing any [268.owner.GetAdjective] reinforcements heading to the region, they will have to accept the situation that it is no longer theirs. Let us send our demand to recognise this state of affairs!"
por.485.d.b:0 "With Mogadishu now threatened by our forces, the Somalis are digging in to protect their homeland. While the capture of all of Somalia is not out of the question, for now Djibouti should suffice."

por.485.b:0 "The War Continues!"

por.486.t:0 "Portuguese Demands"

por.500.t:0 "We have retaken Ceylon!"

por.500.b:0 "We are not finished with them"

por.501.t:0 "Portuguese Capture of Ceylon"
por.501.d:0 "Ceylon is in Portuguese hands, and many in our cabinet demand its recapture. Portugal offers peace in exchange for recognition of its control of Ceylon. What shall we do?"

por.510.t:0 "The Capture of Rhodesia"
por.510.d.a:0 "Wrestled out of the hands of the [545.owner.GetAdjective] government, we now occupy Rhodesia and our forces threaten Pretoria. We can demand the concession of Rhodesia from South Africa, or march further into the Cape."

por.515.t:0 "Victory in the Iraq War"
por.515.d.a:0 "The sick man has once again been humbled and Mesopotamia lies under Portuguese boots. We should demand a ceasefire so we can focus on integrating these oil rich lands into our realm."
por.515.d.b:0 "After a successful landing in Basra, our army has fought its way up the Euphrates and captured Baghdad. While the rest of [291.owner.GetNameDef] still stands, there is a little will to carry on this war after many thousands have already fallen to Portuguese arms. We should appeal to [291.owner.GetName] before we face a protracted conflict in the sand."
por.515.a:0 "Issue the demand!"
por.515.b:0 "No! To [291.owner.capital.GetName]!"

por.516.d:0 "We have been helpless against the Portuguese forces advancing into Iraq, now the land lies under their rule. They now demand hostilities cease and we recognise their occupation. What do we say?"

por.525.d:0 "With our claims in Mittelafrika under our control, and our forces now threatening to push further into Mittelafrika, it is time we consolidated these claims before making any further offensives against the German beast.

por.525.b:0 "They cannot be allowed to exist!"

por.526.t:0 "The Defiant Portuguese"

por.527.t:0 "[879.owner.GetNameDefCap] rejects our demands!"

por.530.t:0 "The Capitulation of German East Asia"
por.530.d:0 "With German East Asia having fallen 3 months ago, Berlin is starting to realise the gravity of the situation in Asia. We can send them demands for peace between us and Berlin, in exchange for the full annexation of the German East Asian holdings."

por.535.t:0 "The Fall of Morocco"
por.535.d:0 "With our full occupation of Morocco, it is quickly becoming clear the region is a naval blindspot for [MOR.faction_leader.GetNameDef], out of reach of [MOR.faction_leader.GetNameDef] proper. We can sue for a 'Peace with Honour', where [MOR.faction_leader.GetNameDef] can sweep this war under the rug and pass it off as a Portuguese invasion of nominally independent Morocco, and instead lodge a minor diplomatic protest at our 'violation of Moroccan sovereignty. This will likely make peace far more likely. Do we issue such a demand or fight on?"
por.535.a:0 "Send the demand!"
por.535.b:0 "No, to [MOR.faction_leader.capital.GetName]!"

por.536.t:0 "The Portugese Have Morocco!"
por.536.d:0 "Portugal has pressed us to accept their annexation of Morocco, explaining that we can save face for this defeat by disowning Morocco as its own independent state and instead of full war, we can lodge a diplomatic protest."

por.537.b:0 "Onwards!"

por.540.t:0 "We have Gibraltar!"
por.540.d.a:0 "Our armies have raced into Gibraltar, and the region is now under our control. We can demand [118.owner.GetNameDef] recognise our annexation of the region in exchange for peace, demands they are likely to accept with the numerous other issues their country faces other then a Portuguese invasion.

POR_core_angola:0 "Incorporate Angola into Portugal"
POR_core_angola_desc:0 "Portuguese boots have stood proudly in Angola since 1575. It is high time we recognise this region is as Portuguese as any European or Atlantic possession. Angola é Nossa!"
POR_core_mos:0 "Incorporate Mozambique into Portugal"
POR_core_mos_desc:0 "As Europeanisation in Mozambique marches forward, it is time this region joins its Portuguese brothers and is integrated into the realm, no longer a mere far-flung colony in South East Africa."
POR_core_goa:0 "Incorporate Goa into Portugal"
POR_core_goa_desc:0 "After over 400 years of Portuguese rule, only interupted by the British during the Napoleonic Wars, it is time the years of trade, in-migration and relgious conversions paid off. Portuguese India is Portugal."
POR_core_macau:0 "Incorporate Macau into Portugal"
POR_core_macau_desc:0 "Since 1557 we have held dominion in Macao. It is one of our oldest territories, and while not very European, the compliant population of Macao will be pleased to become Portuguese, free of the strife to their north."
POR_core_timor:0 "Incorporate East Timor into Portugal"
POR_core_timor_desc:0 "We arrived in Timor in 1515 and it has been a colony since 1702. Neglected by the Republic as an exploitable trading post, this has changed under the Integralists. While remaining mostly illiterate and culturally non-European, the church-educated Portuguese Timorese elite will lead, and the rest follow."
POR_core_guinea:0 "Incorporate Guinea into Portugal"
POR_core_guinea_desc:0 "While suffering particularly from the slump after the British Revolution, and being a centre of revolutionary sentiment, Guinea in recent years has fared well under Portugal, benefitting from its proximity to Cape Verde and the Homeland. It now stands as a compliant region, and will be rewarded with integration."

POR_iberia_cat:0 "Iberian Matters" 
POR_iberia_cat_desc:0 "To our east stands Spain, in constant civil strife as has been the case since the days of Napoleon. What happens in regard to Spain is vital to our sovereignty. Matters with Spain must be settled before they recover and attempt to dominate us once more, this time potentially under a red banner!"
POR_GAL:0 "Reunite with our Northern Brothers"
POR_GAL_desc:0 "Too our north stands Galicia, a region lingustically and culturally similar to us, yet has been dominated and brutalised by the Spanish for hundreds of years. We must assert our control over this region and free what should be a Portuguese province from the Spanish yoke!"
POR_GBR:0 "Take Gibraltar"
POR_GBR_desc:0 "In the aftermath of the British Revolution, the Spanish marched into Gibraltar, asserting their dominance of the straight along with the Rif. This threatens our access to the Mediterranean, which threatens our access to the Suez, which threatens our provinces in India and the Far East! We cannot allow this threat to continue any longer, and we can be assured the Anglo population of Gibraltar and the Morrocans of the Rif will be pleased to be free of the Spanish."
POR_KSP:0 "End Spain"
POR_KSP_desc:0 "With our seizure of both Gibraltar and Galicia, the Spanish are clearly still weak and faultering. If they are allowed to recover, they will surely sweep west, seeking to reclaim the lands we have taken from them. This cannot be allowed to happen. Spain must be destroyed."
POR_restore_order_galicia:0 "Restore Order in Galicia"
POR_restore_order_galicia_desc:0 "Many in Galicia foolishly remain loyal to Spain, while others favour an independent republic. These two groups must be crushed, the loyal population rewarded, and the region administratively integrated into the growing Portuguese realm."
POR_restore_order_gibraltar:0 "Restore Order in Gibraltar"
POR_restore_order_gibraltar_desc:0 "The Anglos of Gibraltar have changed hands numerous times in the last 20 years, and now they fall to us. While they aren't exactly pleased that non-British sovereignty over the territory continues, we may be able to amend this by doing what the Spanish refused to do; Handing local rule to local Anglos, and giving these Anglos a pathway into the Portuguese Imperial bureaucracy. Its a win-win situation, and endearing the Anglos to us will allow us to integrate the small population into our realm successfully."

POR_SA_cat_desc:0 "The vast state of Brazil is overwhelmingly Portuguese speaking, and many there are of Portuguese heritage. This land was never meant to slip from our grasp, and should've remained as much a part of Portugal as any European territory. No matter, we shall right this wrong."
POR_BRA:0 "Reconquer Brazil!"
POR_BRA_desc:0 "It is time to return our rightful South American lands. The human and natural resources of Brazil are just what we need to get our new Empire off the ground. Avante!"
POR_URG:0 "Finish the conflict over Uruguay"
POR_URG_desc:0 "Uruguay has been a battleground between Portuguese and Spanish peoples throughout its history, first between the Spanish and us, then among the Brazilians and Argentines. Unfortunately, in the long term the Spaniards won out, and Portuguese is a minority language confined to northern border regions. This must be corrected for."

POR_SEA_cat:0 "Securing Global Sea Lanes"
POR_SEA_cat_desc:0 "While controlling vast swathes of land is important, it is useless if we can be cut off from them at any moment by a foreign power. We must take the vital straits to ensure that our beautiful homeland is never cut off from parts of Portugal further from the centre."
POR_SUEZ:0 "Seize the Suez" 
POR_SUEZ_desc:0 "When Benjamin Disraeli purchased the Suez Canal Company and sold it to the British government to prevent the French getting their hands on it, our access to the East was secured. However, with the British Revolution and the Cairo Pact-Ottoman confrontation, there has been turmoil at the Suez to say the least. We must perform the service the British did before, and provide safe, uninterupted passage to the east."
POR_PANAMA:0 "Capture the Panama Canal"
POR_PANAMA_desc:0 "With the Second American Civil War throwing the future of the Panama Canal into turmoil, the question of the route to the pacific and of our naval control of the Americas has arisen. The Canal must be wrestled into Portuguese hands."
POR_SING:0 "The Singapore Strategy"
POR_SING_desc:0 "Another stait that in better times the British would have kept open to Portuguese ships. No longer. Now, we must take control of this city with the blood of Portuguese patriots, and if all succeeds, we should consider seizing Eastern Sumatra for full dominance of the Strait of Malacca."
POR_BAB:0 "Control the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait"
POR_BAB_desc:0 "While not as well known as presigious as the Suez, the Bab-el-Mandeb is just as much of a threat to shipping in the East. Now we have the Suez, we must consolidate our hold on the Red Sea."
POR_CON:0 "Capture the Bosphorus"
POR_CON_desc:0 "While access to the Black Sea is not important to us, it may be important to our enemies. Returning Constantinople to Christendom too makes the endeavor worthwhile."

POR_MOR:0 "End Morroco"
POR_MOR_desc:0 "While the Reconquista ended with the Muslims pushed out of Iberia, it can be argued that it didn't go far enough. For years the Mohammadeans have stood tall across the straight of Gibraltar, taunting us. This is an insult to Christendom that we shall stand for no longer!"
POR_NFA:0 "Expand Portuguese Guinea"
POR_NFA_desc:0 "While the French Republic was our ally in the Weltkrieg, they have fallen on hard times. They stand throughout North Africa and West Africa in the blazing sun, extracting what they can from the natives by force under the delusion they can return home. Lets seize their South-Western lands to help them realise the depths of their situation."
POR_LIB:0 "Expand Portuguese West Africa into Liberia"
POR_LIB_desc:0 "Liberia is said to be one of the last "free" African nations. In reality it is ruled by a tiny minority of Americo-Liberians. This minority has formed an aristocracy distinct from the native 98%, differentiating themselves in speech, dress, source and level of income, style of life and culture. Large land purchases were made by the Americo-Liberians from chiefs to whom permanent alienation of land was an unfamiliar concept. They pretend to be a little USA, so let us free the natives as a stepping stone to destroying the real USA."
POR_MAF:0 "Expand into Mittelafrika"
POR_MAF_desc:0 "It was not long ago when we seemingly neutralised the threat of Mittelafrika. Many international observers believed such a humiliation might bring down the hulking inefficent juggernaut. This has not come to pass, and now Mittelafrika continues to sit to our north and south, licking its wounds, planning to sieze our African holdings for good! We can no longer tolerate such a threat. Mittelafrika is an anti-civilisational abomination that must be cleansed from existance. We shall take border regions that make Mittelafrika unable to touch the Ultramarine Provinces, or properly function for that matter."
POR_RHO:0 "Rhodesian Reunification"
POR_RHO_desc:0 "With our hold on North Rhodesia secured, we turn south, where our Anglo friends now form a sizable minority of the population. South Rhodesia has been well managed by these settlers, with a balanced budget and increasing wages among settlers and natives. We should protect these Anglos from the vicious Boers to their South, or any potential native threat that they may struggle against. The region should prove economically valuable to us, and the Anglo adminstrators may prove useful in the management of our holdings which continue to increase in number and strain the state."
POR_IND:0 "A Buffer for Goa"
POR_IND_desc:0 "Our proud province of Goa stands as an example of Portuguese civilisation among a sea of conflict and strife that is the Indian subcontinent. However, not all is well, as the constant threat of the siezure of Goa hangs over the provice like the Sword of Damocles. We do not yet seek to rule all of India, however a sparsely populated region that would take little administrative toll on our nation lies to the East of Goa, a suitable buffer for our grand province. It may too prove useful in the future if we decide to expand our ambitions. We must take this region at all costs. Into India!"
POR_DEI:0 "Riches of the East Indies"
POR_DEI_desc:0 "Our small territory of East Timor stands surrounded by the Indonesian territories, with the island of Timor itself in need of full unification. We shall sieze West Timor and take other strategically important and resource rich islands."
POR_GEA:0 "Strike the Germanic presence in the Far East!"
POR_GEA_desc:0 "Mittelafrika and German East Asia. Two talons of the Germanic Eagle, the former based on dominance of large swathes of land, the latter based on dominance of the seas. We shall break the thalassocracy, and annex the territories of it into our growing empire!"
POR_CEY:0 "Reclaim Ceylon!"
POR_CEY_desc:0 "We lost Ceylon after years of rule in 1658. After falling to the Dutch, then the British, and then the Germans, rule of the island has circulated among many European powers after falling from our grasp. Evidence of the Portuguese civilising mission still exists to this day, and it is time we resume it. §RWe may also attempt to seize the Maldives should the owner of Ceylon own them, however it is only of secondary importance to us so we won't have the option to seize them later.§!"

POR_OIL_cat:0 "Black Gold for Portugal"
POR_OIL_cat_desc:0 "With oil supplies increasingly important, we must make sure that our fleet and forces have the fuel to feed them. Venezuela, the Ottoman Turks, Iran. 3 targets that invading will ensure we dominate the global oil supply."
POR_TUR:0 "Iraq War"
POR_TUR_desc:0 "While we have claimed to the international community that chemical weapons are being used in Iraq and we are protecting the peoples of Mesopotamia, in reality we seek to take the resources that the region contains. It is for the greater good of allowing our fair hand to spread further across the globe. §RShould the owner also control Khuzestan we shall attempt to seize it as well. We will retain the option to seize it later otherwise.§!"
POR_IRA:0 "War for the Persian Gulf"

We shall move from Macau into Guangdong, establish our own government for China, then go on our own Northern Expedition until all China is under the Portuguese banner! Many in the King's Cabinet call this plan madness, a waste of Portuguese lives. Let us show them, there is no madness when we know God is on our side!"

POR_rivals_cat_desc:0 "While our Imperial Ambitions seem selfish on the surface, they all serve a greater good. Since the French Revolution, accelerated by the Weltkrieg, a number of evils have taken root. The Evil of Liberalism, a leveling, equalising, egalitarian force that seeks to create a society of mass man - of interchangable people undifferentiated from eachother, no longer united under God, but united in consumption, no matter how degenerate this consumption is. To destroy this we shall eliminate the centre of this evil - the United States of America, before they grow strong enough to dominate the world and bathe it in liberalism. Then there is the Evil of Syndicalism, another equalising force taking the equality aspect of liberalism to its logical conclusion - equality of outcome, and this anti-nature force too must be smothered in its crib. We shall free our old friends, the British, from this evil, and destroy the perfidious French and their vile commune. These evils aside, there are the powers of Japan and Germany, the former threatening God fearing Europeans in the East, the latter butching its way through the God fearing of Europe, and the globe. We shall destroy Japanese naval supremacy in the East, and gain long desired revenge against the Germanic hoarde."

POR_GER_desc:0 "The Germans saw us as little more than a nuisance during the Weltkreig. This attitude changed little until we crushed Mittelafrika. However, they still don't know just how much of a folly their underestimation was. Let us fly the Portuguese flag over the Reichstag to show them!"

POR_luso_desc:0 "Based on the work of Gilberto Freyre, we have embraced the ideas of Lusotropicalism. Building on five centuries of our humane civilising mission, we have given further devolved powers to our overseas territories, encouraged mixing between Iberian-Portuguese subjects and natives abroad, and reduced levels of repression against natives. While the results have been mixed, we are generally experiencing a higher level of consent for our governance overseas."

Among the settlers, soldiers, engineers and others who kept the vast empire going, were a number of highly skilled administrators.

Global traders are relieved to no longer have to go around the Cape to reach their destinations, and are very much willing to pay the tolls we charge at the canal.

However, as the trickle of both African and European refugees turned into a flood, it has quickly become apparent that Mittelafrika has totally collapsed. Two major defeats and one mass evacuation had left Mittelafrika as a shadow of its former self. This shadow still looms over Africa, as the failure of the Germanic civilising mission is evident wherever their vile boots have stepped on this continent. With this collapse, we stand as the last major European power in Africa, with the French being more prisoners of Africa then a power in their own right on it. With the old German African Hegemony shattered, we can now do as we please on the continent, and reap the great rewards of doing so."

By bringing in expertise from across the Empire and the World, we will change this."
